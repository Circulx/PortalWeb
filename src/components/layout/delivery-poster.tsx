        Image Size Recommendations for Perfect Fit:
        
        Based on the new heights (h-40 to h-56), here are the optimal image dimensions:
        
        Responsive Heights:
        - Mobile (h-40): 160px height
        - Small (h-44): 176px height  
        - Medium (h-48): 192px height
        - Large (h-52): 208px height
        - XL (h-56): 224px height
        
        Recommended Image Sizes:
        1. Standard Resolution: 1200x224px (5.36:1 aspect ratio)
        2. High Resolution: 2400x448px (for Retina displays)
        3. Ultra Wide: 1920x224px (for larger screens)
        
        Alternative Sizes:
        - Conservative: 1000x200px
        - Wide Format: 1500x280px
        - Banner Style: 1800x300px
        
        File Format Recommendations:
        - JPG: For photographic content (smaller file size)
        - PNG: For graphics with transparency or text
        - WebP: Best compression and quality (modern browsers)
        
        Optimization Tips:
        - Keep file size under 150KB for fast loading
        - Use progressive JPEG for better perceived performance
        - Consider lazy loading for below-the-fold content
