                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mb-4 flex items-center"> Expanded Business Risks in Returns and Cancellations</h2>
                    <p className="text-lg text-black  font-bold text-left mb-2">To safeguard commercial transactions, Users should be aware of the following potential risks:

                  </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base text-black text-left mb-6">
                    <li>Operational Risk: Errors in order entry, product picking, shipping, or invoicing may cause disputes over cancellations and returns.</li>
                    <li>Product Risk: Items may be returned in a degraded, used, or counterfeit condition, leading to financial losses or fraud.</li>
                    <li>Financial Risk: Refunds requested after payment settlement may create cash flow strain, credit risks, or accounting issues.</li>
                    <li>Fraud Risk: False claims of non-delivery, staged damages, or fraudulent chargebacks are common in returns abuse.</li>
                    <li>Insurance Gaps: Standard goods-in-transit insurance may not cover reverse logistics or returns in some jurisdictions.</li>
                    <li>Regulatory Risk: Some goods cannot be legally returned (e.g., pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, medical devices) unless explicitly permitted under law.</li>
                    <li>Tax Risk: GST/VAT adjustments, reversal of input credits, or documentation errors during returns can trigger audits or penalties.</li>
                    <li>Technology Risk: System failures, server outages, or data mismatches can lead to processing errors or unrecorded cancellations.</li>
                    <li>Logistics Risk: Loss, theft, or damage during reverse shipping is a common point of dispute, especially when carriers change hands.</li>
                    <li>Reputational Risk: Improper handling of returns and cancellations can lead to negative reviews, blacklisting, or public complaints, impacting future business.</li>
                    <li>Legal Risk: Unresolved return disputes may escalate into litigation, arbitration, or claims under consumer protection or unfair trade practices laws (where applicable to B2B dealings).</li>
                    <li>Currency & Cross-Border Risk: International transactions may involve foreign exchange fluctuations or remittance blockages during refunds.</li>
                    <li>Force Majeure: Events such as pandemics, supply chain shutdowns, port closures, or natural disasters can affect return and cancellation logistics beyond the control of either party.</li>
